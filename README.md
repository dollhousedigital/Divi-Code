# Divi-Code

This is my simple storage of Divi CSS, HTML, PHP and jQuery Code.
Added to this repository for my own ease of use during new builds.

I have collected these from previous websites I have completed.

Some of the code I have put together myself, others have been collected from forums, blogs and facebook groups etc.

The repository is public - as I believe in sharing with the community as others have with me.
I have just grabbed most of this code from my websites - So I have no idea who the original coders were of certain elements.
If you notice some of your code here and wish to be credited, please just drop me a line and I'll be sure to add your details.
